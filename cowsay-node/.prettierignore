# Sometimes you have files that should not be formatted: auto-generated source files, saved snapshots, etc.
# You can list file masks to ignore in this file .prettierignore.
# For example, to ignore all JavaScript files in snapshots folders use:

## do not run Prettier against JavaScript files
## in "snapshots/" folders
#**/snapshots/*.js
